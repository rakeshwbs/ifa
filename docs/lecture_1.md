What is the Internet?
The Internet is a globally interconnected network of computers and devices that communicate using standardized protocols (like TCP/IP) to share information, resources, and services. It enables the exchange of data across vast distances and supports a wide range of applications, such as email, web browsing, file sharing, and online communication. Often referred to as the "network of networks," the Internet relies on infrastructure like servers, routers, and undersea cables to connect users worldwide.
